DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_HALLO_03_01.wav|The Sleeper be with you, stranger!
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_03_01.wav|Well - the Gurus are the most important people here. They spread the word of the Sleeper and pass our master's visions on to the novices.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_03_02.wav|Of course he's too tired to talk to everybody himself.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_03_03.wav|But on some days he speaks to us in the temple courtyard and reveals the holy words of the Sleeper.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_CASUAL_03_01.wav|The Sleeper guides the way. But an infidel like you wouldn't understand that!
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_HOLY_03_01.wav|HE tells us what we need to do to gain freedom again.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_HOLY_03_02.wav|Y'Berion says that the Sleeper will show us the way as soon as we're able to hear him.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_HOLY_03_03.wav|He's preparing a great invocation, in which he'll contact the Sleeper together with the best novices.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_HOLY_03_04.wav|Cor Kalom supports him. He's an alchemist who brews substances which put us into a sleep-like state.
DUMMY/DIA_NYRAS_ORT_HOLY_03_05.wav|You can only receive the thoughts of the Sleeper in this state - or when sleeping.
DUMMY/NOV_1303_NYRAS_GREET_INFO_03_00.wav|Scram! You have no business to be here!
DUMMY/NOV_1303_NYRAS_LEAVE_INFO_03_02.wav|Unfortunately you're too late for that. I've already found it!
DUMMY/NOV_1303_NYRAS_LEAVE_INFO_03_03.wav|And I'm keeping it for myself!
DUMMY/NOV_1303_NYRAS_LEAVE_INFO_03_05.wav|Now I'll only serve the Sleeper. No more templars or Gurus!
