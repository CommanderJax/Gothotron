DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_INTRUDER_14_00.wav|What are you doing here? You've no business here! Scram!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_EXIT_14_01.wav|May you return in one piece!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_14_02.wav|Y'Berion dead? That's bad news, very bad news indeed!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_14_03.wav|Who's leading the Brotherhood now? That power-hungry and deceitful Cor Kalom?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_14_05.wav|Why is that? He was in second place after Y'Berion!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_14_09.wav|I see! Well, at least we are lucky in this regard. Cor Angar is a good man. He's tough, but honest.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_14_10.wav|If anybody could prevent the Brotherhood from falling apart after this spiritual catastrophe, he can.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BOOK_14_03.wav|Very good. We need the knowledge contained in this book to charge the five original focus stones.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BOOK_14_04.wav|I'll take the almanac!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_14_02.wav|You're holding the key that can unlock all our bonds.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_14_03.wav|It is one of the five focus stones which were used to create the Magic Barrier.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_14_04.wav|And with the help of the very same focusing power of these stones, we will tear down the great wall of energy.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_14_07.wav|As you must know, each ore nugget contains a certain amount of magic power. With the aid of the energy thus amassed in the ore mound, we'll be able to destroy the Magic Barrier.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_14_09.wav|The explosion will be merely of a magical nature, it will only destroy everything that's been modified by the magic inside the Barrier. There is no danger to us human beings.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_WHATNOW_14_03.wav|Nothing. We need the four remaining focus stones first!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_WHATNOW_14_04.wav|Unfortunately we don't have any of these four magic stones.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_03.wav|I must warn you. Searching for them will prove as difficult as it will be dangerous.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_04.wav|Since conflict with the Old Camp is getting worse every day, I cannot give you any mercenary either.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_05.wav|You'll be totally on your own.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_07.wav|Your confidence does you credit, but you'll need some items to assist you.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_08.wav|Take this map here. It's old, but on it you'll see the original locations of the focus stones when the Barrier was created.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_09.wav|Also, this spell scroll will enable you to travel back to our camp faster.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_10.wav|Finally, you need to speak to Riordian. He brews the potions for the Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_14_11.wav|You'll find him in his hut, here, on the upper level.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_01.wav|Hm, that's a start. You're doing well.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_02.wav|There are still three focus stones missing to accomplish our plan.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_03.wav|Now go and look out for the remaining focus stones.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_04.wav|Good, that's the second focus stone you've brought us.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_05.wav|We're getting closer and closer to our target.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_06.wav|Be brave and fetch the two remaining focus stones.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_07.wav|Unbelievable, now we have four focus stones altogether.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_08.wav|There's only one more missing, then we'll have them all.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_09.wav|You have already done our community a great service. Get the last focus stone, and we'll soon be able to free ourselves.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_10.wav|Brilliant, now we have all five focus stones.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_11.wav|Your deeds are invaluable to our camp. Be assured of my eternal gratitude.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_12.wav|Go to Riordian now. He'll give you something for your immense efforts.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_13.wav|Speak to Cronos, the keeper of the ore, as well. He will give you another gift from our community.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS_14_14.wav|I see you've used up the teleportation scroll. Here, take a new one.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_14_02.wav|We now have all the artefacts we need to fulfill our plan.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_14_03.wav|But the Barrier was created by twelve magicians.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_14_04.wav|There are not enough magicians in the Circle of Water to control the powerful energies and to guide them onto the right course.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_14_06.wav|I am aware that you have already done much for our community, we owe you greatly...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_14_07.wav|... but in the interest of all the inhabitants of the colony, I need to ask one more favor of you.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_14_02.wav|Yes. Go to the Old Camp and try to win some of the Magicians of the Circle of Fire for our cause.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_14_05.wav|That is the exact reason why YOU must accomplish this mission. You know people from all the camps of the colony.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_14_06.wav|Remind the Magicians of Fire of the old times, when we studied the arts of magic together.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_14_03.wav|You must try. If you do not succeed in this, there is only one other...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_14_06.wav|Forget it! You MUST succeed!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_14_07.wav|Here, take this magic rune. Hand it over to Corristo, the High Magician of the Circle of Fire, as a sign of our trust.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_14_08.wav|With this he can teleport into this room without passing the guards anytime he wants.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_14_09.wav|I hope that'll convince our former friends of our good intentions.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_14_01.wav|I'm glad you returned. Something terrible's happened!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_14_03.wav|Hang on... how... but of course... You found out about it in the Old Camp!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_14_04.wav|Gorn arrived here just before you did.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_14_05.wav|What could have caused Gomez to dare to take such an aggressive step?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_14_06.wav|He should be aware that such a heinous act can only provoke war.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_COLLAPSE_14_02.wav|... Collapsed... of course... then the whole thing makes sense.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_COLLAPSE_14_03.wav|Gomez has his back to the wall. He's more dangerous than ever. Now that he doesn't have anything left to lose, he'll do anything!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_MURDER_14_05.wav|But in spite of that, I thank you for passing this dangerous message on to me.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_NOMOREOC_INFO_14_02.wav|You don't belong to the Old Camp any longer?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_NOMOREOC_INFO_14_03.wav|Then I welcome you to our community.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_GOTOLEE_INFO_14_02.wav|Talk to Lee. He'll see to it. Then come back to me.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_14_02.wav|Not yet. First you need to take the oath of Water.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_14_04.wav|Hmmm....
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_14_05.wav|It doesn't mean you're breaking your vow!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_14_07.wav|You're extending your vow. That way you'll become a magician of both elements!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_14_08.wav|Then you'll have the force of Fire as well as the wisdom of Water!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_02.wav|Servant of the Fire, you shall now receive the blessing of the Water!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_03.wav|Now speak the words of the oath:
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_04.wav|I swear by the might of the gods...
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_06.wav|... and by the power of the holy Water...
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_08.wav|... that my knowledge and my deeds from now on and forever shall be one with the Water...
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_10.wav|... until my body shall return to the realm of Beliar and the source of my life shall dry out.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_12.wav|With this oath you unite the power of the Fire and the blessing of the Water within you.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_13.wav|You have now bound together what was apart before. May your life be a sign of the unification of the elements.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_14_14.wav|Wear this robe as a sign of your bond with the holy Water and with Adanos.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_LESSON_INFO_14_02.wav|There's much you need to learn. I shall teach you as soon as you're ready.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_LESSON_INFO_14_03.wav|There is one more Circle you don't know yet. I shall teach you as soon as you're ready.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_LESSON_INFO_14_04.wav|You have already mastered the Fifth Circle of Magic! You know all I know.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_LESSON_INFO_14_05.wav|I can't teach you any more!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_02.wav|To enter the first of the magic Circles means learning to use magic runes.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_03.wav|Each rune contains the structure of a special magic spell.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_04.wav|By using your own magic powers, you'll be able to cast the magic of the rune.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_05.wav|But in contrast to the magic scrolls, which are magic formulas as well, the magic power of the rune ensures that the structure of the spell endures.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_07.wav|Your own magic power is used up when you use a rune, just as with a spell scroll.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_08.wav|With every Circle you enter, you learn to use further runes as well.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_14_09.wav|Use the power of the runes to recognize yourself.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_02.wav|You have learned to understand the runes. Now it is time to deepen this understanding.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_03.wav|When you join the Second Circle you will learn the foundations of stronger battle spells, and above all the secret of healing.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_04.wav|But you need to learn much if you want to recognize the true secrets of magic.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_05.wav|You know that you can use every rune as often as you like until you've used up all your own powers.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_06.wav|But before you act, think about the point of your actions. You have obtained powers with which you may easily conjure up death and destruction.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_07.wav|But a true magician only uses magic when it is necessary.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS2_INFO_14_08.wav|Understand the situation, then you'll recognize the power of the runes.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_02.wav|The Third Circle of Magic is one of the most important steps in the life of a magician. Once you've reached it, you cease to be a seeker.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_03.wav|You have already come far on the path of magic. You have learned to use the runes.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_04.wav|This knowledge is the foundation for your further path. Use the runes with deliberation.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_05.wav|You may use a rune or not. But you must decide on one of these possibilities.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_06.wav|Do not hesitate to use your powers as soon as you've made your choice.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS3_INFO_14_07.wav|Understand your path, then you'll recognize the power of the decision.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_02.wav|You have completed the first three Circles. Now is the time for you to learn the secrets of magic.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_03.wav|The magic of the runes is based on the stone. They are magic stones, created out of magic ore.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_04.wav|It is the same ore which is collected in the mines. This ore is endowed with magic formulas in the temples. There the runes are converted to the instruments of our power.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_05.wav|With the runes you control now, you have the entire knowledge of the temples of the realm at your fingertips.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_07.wav|Understand the magic, then you'll discover the secret of power.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS5_INFO_14_02.wav|So be it. I shall teach you the power of the Fifth Circle.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS5_INFO_14_03.wav|The Storm of Fire, the Wave of Ice and the power to destroy the undead are now spells whose runes you can use.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS5_INFO_14_04.wav|But the mightiest spell of the Fifth Circle is the Ripple of Death. If you ever possess this rune, you'll have dangerous powers.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS5_INFO_14_05.wav|Be careful to use this kind of magic as little as possible. It's a gift from the god of darkness.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS4_INFO_14_06.wav|You have now learned everything I can teach you.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_HEAVYARMOR_INFO_14_02.wav|It is not yet time for you to wear the high robe.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_HEAVYARMOR_INFO_14_03.wav|The little ore that you have won't even cover the manufacturing costs.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_HEAVYARMOR_INFO_14_04.wav|The time has come. You are worthy of wearing the high robe of Water.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_NOWSLD_14_02.wav|Good. Very good. Then you are now officially a part of our community.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_NOWSLD_14_03.wav|Be welcome!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_02.wav|Well, I had hoped we could make it without his help, but the way things are developing...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_04.wav|Alright, alright!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_05.wav|Many, many years ago...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_07.wav|Be patient! Well, when we - the twelve magicians - created the Barrier back then, our magic powers were directed and controlled by a thirteenth magician.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_09.wav|Most people who did not experience the early days of the colony believe that.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_10.wav|This thirteenth magician was our leader. All this took place before we were divided into the Circles of Fire and Water.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_14_11.wav|But he left the Old Camp, which was once the only camp of the colony.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHO_14_02.wav|His name is Xardas. Hardly anybody remembers the old stories about him!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHO_14_03.wav|The ones who do just call him the NECROMANCER!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHY_14_02.wav|He started to investigate the invocation of undead and magical creatures.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHY_14_03.wav|Gomez was not the only one who began to worry. Most of the other magicians opposed him as well and his unholy deeds.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHY_14_05.wav|Unlike Gomez, he was no butcher, so he avoided the conflict and left.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHERE_14_02.wav|He lives in seclusion, in his tower in the middle of the Orc land.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHERE_14_03.wav|That's just about the southernmost point of the colony.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASHELP_14_02.wav|He's the only one that can help us now.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASHELP_14_03.wav|If he knows no way out or doesn't want to help us...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASHELP_14_05.wav|There is one other problem...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_14_02.wav|Yes. Over the years we have tried to get in touch with Xardas several times.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_14_03.wav|But it looks like he prefers to remain undisturbed.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_14_05.wav|None of the messengers ever returned from his tower.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_14_06.wav|You'll have to find a way to get past his creatures.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_14_02.wav|If I knew that, I would tell you!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_14_03.wav|I'd advise you to do some research in our library.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_14_04.wav|Maybe you'll find something in the old books about the strengths and weaknesses of magically invoked creatures.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_14_02.wav|Well ..? Well what?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_14_06.wav|Why not?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_14_08.wav|You need to find him and ask him for advice!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_14_10.wav|What do you mean? He needs to find a way how to blow up the ore mound!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_14_12.wav|Find Xardas, he needs to help!
