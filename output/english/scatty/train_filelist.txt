DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_WHATDOYOUDO_01_01.wav|I'm in charge of the arena. I organize the bets, hire new fighters... You know.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_JOINOC_01_01.wav|I might be able to, if you manage to impress me.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_JOINOC_01_02.wav|Some of the best fighters from all three camps come here to compete against each other.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_JOINOC_01_03.wav|Challenge one of them to a fight. I'll watch you, and if you're good maybe I'll think about it.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KIRGOSUCCESS_01_02.wav|Surely you don't expect me to be impressed by that...
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KIRGOSUCCESS_01_03.wav|And you defeated him! That's not bad for a beginner like you! I'm impressed!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KHARIMSUCCESS_01_01.wav|And boy, did he whack you!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KHARIMSUCCESS_01_02.wav|Still, you chose the right opponent! I just can't stand those bastards from the New Camp.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KHARIMSUCCESS_01_04.wav|And you knocked him down! I have to admit that wasn't bad going. He's always been known as one of the toughest fighters.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_KHARIMSUCCESS_01_05.wav|I'm deeply impressed!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_OTHERCAMPS_01_01.wav|It's simple: There's fights here once a week, and the diggers always like to see one of the rogues from the New Camp get flattened.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_OTHERCAMPS_01_02.wav|If one of them fights, there's more bets - and that's good for business!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_OTHERCAMPS_01_03.wav|Personally, I can't stand the swines from the New Camp - but business is business...
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_WANNABET_01_01.wav|But there's no fight on.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_WANNABET_01_02.wav|The next fight's due in a couple of days. There'll be an announcement.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_WANNAFIGHT_01_01.wav|I can't let you fight until you've joined one of the camps!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_WANNAFIGHT_01_02.wav|Nobody wants to see an independent fighter!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_01_01.wav|Yeah, but not just for fun. If you want me to train you, you'll have to pay for it.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_01.wav|That's a good decision! Before you can improve your technique, you'll have to learn how to hold the weapon right.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_02.wav|Beginners often tend to hold one-handed weapons with both hands. Now, don't even start getting into that habit, it'll do you no good.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_03.wav|Hold the weapon with one hand, blade up, and keep swinging it.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_04.wav|You have to learn to harmonize your weapon's swing with your own movements. That'll make you faster in the attack.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_05.wav|If you keep in mind what I've taught you, your fights will be more elegant and a lot faster in future.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_06.wav|Oh yeah, one more thing: Some hits cause more damage than others! As a beginner, you don't stand much of a chance of making critical hits.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_01_07.wav|But the further you progress, the better you get.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_1H_NOORE_01_00.wav|You don't have enough ore!
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_2H_INFO_01_02.wav|Okay, you know the basics. Holding the weapon lower down will let you put more force into your first strike.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_2H_INFO_01_03.wav|Use the swing, remember? Okay, now you need to use your body more. When you've struck twice, spin around. That'll confuse the opponent and put you in an excellent position.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_2H_INFO_01_04.wav|Then bring your blade across from right to left once more.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_2H_INFO_01_05.wav|And back to the front. Don't forget: practice makes perfect. So, get going and master the art of one-handed fighting.
DUMMY/DIA_SCATTY_TRAIN_2H_NOORE_01_00.wav|Come back when you have enough ore!
