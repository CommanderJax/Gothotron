DUMMY/DIA_BAALISIDRO_HELLO_03_02.wav|I need to get rid of a whole pile of weed.
DUMMY/DIA_BAALISIDRO_TRADE_03_01.wav|Here...
DUMMY/DIA_BAALISIDRO_GIMMEKRAUT_03_01.wav|Forget it - I'm not as drunk as all that. You'd just go running away with it.

DUMMY/DIA_BAALISIDRO_RUNNING_03_03.wav|Good... Now I don't give a damn about Baal Kagan any more.
DUMMY/DIA_BAALISIDRO_RUNNING_03_04.wav|It was a good idea to do business with you.
