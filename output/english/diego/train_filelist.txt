DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_GAMESTART_11_00.wav|I'm Diego.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_GAMESTART_11_02.wav|I'm not interested in who you are. You've just arrived. I look after the new arrivals. That's all for now.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_GAMESTART_11_03.wav|If you plan to stay alive for a while, you should talk to me. But of course I won't keep you from choosing your own destruction. Well, what do you think?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_EXIT_GAMESTART_11_01.wav|It's your decision. It's been nice knowing you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_EXIT_GAMESTART_11_02.wav|We'll meet in the Old Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_EXIT_11_01.wav|Let's go on.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_11_01.wav|Really...?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_11_03.wav|You're lucky I can't afford to show my face around the mages any more. Anyone else would gladly slit your throat for that letter.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_11_04.wav|That's because the mages pay their couriers a lot and most people here don't have anything.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_11_05.wav|If I were you I'd shut up until I met one of the mages. Although, in your situation, that's not likely to happen.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_11_07.wav|The mages are in the castle in the Old Camp. Only Gomez' people are allowed to enter the castle.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_11_01.wav|Because you needed help, otherwise Bullit and his boys might have killed you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_11_02.wav|And I couldn't just stand by and watch. 'Cos I came all this way to make a suggestion.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_11_04.wav|Yes. After this little incident with Bullit and his guys, you should be aware now that you need protection.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_11_05.wav|Everyone who arrives here has a choice. There are three camps in the colony, and you'll have to join one of them.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_11_06.wav|I'm here to show the new ones that the Old Camp is the best place for them.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BULLIT_11_03.wav|He and the others bring the goods from the outside world into the Camp. You'll find him there.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BULLIT_11_04.wav|But if you plan to fight him, be careful. He's an experienced warrior.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_KOLONIE_11_01.wav|We call it the colony. You'll know already that we produce ore for the King.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_KOLONIE_11_02.wav|Well, at least we do - in the Old Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_11_01.wav|There isn't much to tell. It's impenetrable.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_11_03.wav|The last one who tried that reached the other side a dead man. This damned Barrier let's you in, but you'll never get out of here.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_11_05.wav|You're already in a rush to get out of here? But you've only just arrived!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_11_01.wav|The two other camps split up to pursue their crazy escape plans.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_11_02.wav|There's the New Camp in the west of the colony, where the mages think they can just detonate the Barrier as soon as they've scraped enough ore together.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_11_03.wav|And then there's the sect loonies in the east. Their camp is in the middle of the swamp, and they're praying to their idol to set them free.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_11_04.wav|He hasn't responded so far.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_11_05.wav|If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time on those madcaps.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OLDCAMP_11_01.wav|It's the biggest and most powerful of the three camps. Gomez and his guys control the Camp and thereby the whole ore trade.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OLDCAMP_11_02.wav|Once a month, the King sends us everything we need. We've got the old guy in our grip, you understand?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OLDCAMP_11_03.wav|He sends us wine, bread, meat, weapons... everything.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OLDCAMP_11_04.wav|You can also get some of it. All you have to do is join Gomez' people.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WHOSGOMEZ_11_01.wav|Gomez is the most powerful Ore Baron. He's the boss of the Old Camp - the most powerful man in the colony.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINOLDCAMP_11_01.wav|At the gate of the castle you'll find a man called Thorus. Tell him Diego sent you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WAYTOOLDCAMP_11_01.wav|You just follow this path. The Old Camp is the next reasonably safe-looking place you'll come across.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WAYTOOLDCAMP_11_02.wav|There are a lot of wild beasts between the camps. You'd  be mad to walk around without a weapon.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WOWAFFE_11_01.wav|When you get to the Old Mine, have a look around. I'm sure you'll find something useful.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WOWAFFE_11_02.wav|The mine is easy to find, it's just a few meters along the canyon.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_THORUSSAYS_11_01.wav|And what did he say?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_THORUSSAYS_11_03.wav|Looks like I have myself a new job.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_RULES_11_01.wav|If you want to join the Camp you'll have to earn some brownie points.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_RULES_11_02.wav|There're a few influential people in the Outer Ring. Most of them are Shadows. If you manage to impress them, it'll earn you a few brownie points.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_RULES_11_03.wav|Then you'll have to stand the test of faith.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_RULES_11_04.wav|Besides there are a lot of skills every new arrival has to learn. The more you learn, the more valuable you'll be for us.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_CELEBS_11_01.wav|Well, you're looking at one of them. Then there's Thorus... you already know him.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_CELEBS_11_02.wav|As for the others... you'll have to find that out by yourself. If you don't manage to do that, you don't belong here anyway.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_CELEBS_11_03.wav|Just go through the Outer Ring and talk to people, then you'll find out who's important.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACHERS_11_01.wav|Start with Fingers. He's the most skillful among us.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACHERS_11_02.wav|If you keep your eyes peeled, you'll find other people who can teach you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACHERS_11_04.wav|His hut's kind of hidden. It's next to the castle wall. Just start out here and go towards the arena.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACHERS_11_05.wav|When you're at the castle gate, go down to the left and you'll be heading for the arena.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACH_11_01.wav|Yes. I can teach you to improve your dexterity or your strength.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACH_BACK_11_00.wav|Your strength has increased a lot.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACH_BACK_11_01.wav|Your skills in using the bow and the crossbow have improved.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACH_BACK_11_02.wav|Come back soon - there are many things you need to learn!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_11_01.wav|You have to go to the Old Mine. There you'll meet a guy called Ian. He'll give you a list.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_11_02.wav|This list is important. It contains all the items the guys in the mine need from us.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_11_03.wav|They'll get the stuff with the next convoy!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_11_05.wav|Yes, there is a problem! The New Camp must not get that list!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_11_06.wav|Like I said: The list is important. If you do it right, you'll get much further.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_MAPTOOLDMINE_INFO_11_01.wav|Go to Graham. He's a cartographer. Tell him that I sent you and that you need a map. It'll show you the way to the mine.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_MAPTOOLDMINE_INFO_11_02.wav|He lives to the left of the north gate.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_11_01.wav|I've talked to a few people...
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_01.wav|Scatty told me you defeated Kirgo.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_02.wav|Scatty told me you let Kirgo beat you. He didn't seem to be very enthusiastic.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_03.wav|Scatty has told me he's anxious to see how you come off against Kirgo.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_04.wav|But he was impressed by you having the courage to fight against Kharim, even though you've been defeated.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_05.wav|But he was greatly impressed that you defeated Kharim - he wouldn't stop talking about you at all.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SCATTY_11_06.wav|And he's anxious to see if you'll challenge Kharim.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_WHISTLER_11_01.wav|Whistler told me the story about Fisk... Well, if I was you I would have taken the ore and cleared off. But anyway - he thinks a great deal of you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_WHISTLER_11_02.wav|I've talked to Whistler. You took his ore, you clever bastard! I must admit, you're quite brave!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_WHISTLER_11_03.wav|Whistler is waiting for his sword. You should make up your mind whether to bring it to him or not, otherwise he'll think that you've cleared off with his ore!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_SLY_11_02.wav|I think Sly's wrong about Nek. He was a real pain, that's true, but I don't think he went to the New Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_FINGERS_11_02.wav|Fingers told me that you've already learned a bit, but he thinks you can still improve your skills.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_DEXTER_11_01.wav|I really need to talk to Dexter. He's using you for his own business.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_DEXTER_11_02.wav|But there aren't any rules for the test. If you manage THAT you'll be making a big step.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_DEXTER_11_03.wav|You've really managed to get the recipe from Kalom. Dexter is very impressed, and so am I.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_THORUS_11_01.wav|The business with Mordrag is really quite a job. He's not bad as a warrior. You should exercise if you really want to defeat him.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_THORUS_11_02.wav|Thorus says we could make use of someone like you - that's very good for you.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_THORUS_11_03.wav|Thorus's head nearly burst because he was raging mad - how dare you screw up the job LIKE THIS?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_FISK_11_01.wav|Fisk told me you surprised him. In any case he'll be on your side.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_FISK_11_02.wav|Fisk is really pissed off with you. If I were you I'd look for someone to replace Mordrag.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_POINTS_11_00.wav|You've found enough people to speak in your favor.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_POINTS_11_01.wav|You also passed the test of faith. Go to Thorus. I've already told him everything. He'll let you go to see Gomez.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_POINTS_11_02.wav|But you still have to pass the test of faith.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_POINTS_11_10.wav|All things considered, that's not too bad for a newcomer.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_POINTS_11_20.wav|Get on with it! There are still many things to do if you wanna get anywhere here in the Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WHATTOSAYTOGOMEZ_INFO_11_01.wav|Gomez' decisions are made from gut instinct. He'll look at your mug and then he'll make up his mind if you can join.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WHATTOSAYTOGOMEZ_INFO_11_02.wav|From now on you'll have to get by on your own - make the best of it! Good luck.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_ARMOR_INFO_11_02.wav|Do you have enough ore?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_ARMOR_INFO_11_03.wav|Get the ore, then you'll get the armor.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_00.wav|Hey, I thought you were dead.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_02.wav|A lot of things have happened since we last met. I hear you've contributed a great deal to the final invocation.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_04.wav|Better than you think... Now you're looking for the focus?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_06.wav|I know where to find one. There's just one problem.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_08.wav|You've really learnt your lesson, but that's not what I meant.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_10.wav|It's three tons of a problem.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_11_11.wav|Let's go. You'll understand in a moment.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_SHOWFOCUS_INFO_11_01.wav|On the left side of this canyon lies the entrance to a cave that leads to the location of the focus.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_SHOWFOCUS_INFO_11_03.wav|Try to find a weak point or another possibility to defeat the troll.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_SHOWFOCUS_INFO_11_04.wav|I'll attract his attention.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_AFTERTROLL_INFO_11_01.wav|That was fantastic. You're really good. And now, go get the focus.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_AFTERTROLL_INFO_11_02.wav|I'll make sure that there won't be any other awkward surprises.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_WHEEL_INFO_11_01.wav|The winch seems to be jammed.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_WHEEL_INFO_11_02.wav|Let me see, maybe I can fix it!
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_WAITATFOCUS_INFO_11_01.wav|Get the focus and I'll wait for you here!
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_GOTIT_INFO_11_01.wav|Hey, you've found the focus. Very good.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_GOTIT_INFO_11_02.wav|I think it's time for me to stop by at the Old Camp again. Good luck.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_GOTIT_INFO_11_04.wav|We'll meet again.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_11_01.wav|Hey... Shhh... Be quiet!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_11_03.wav|Okay, so you already know what happened.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_11_04.wav|But did you also hear about the planned raid on the Free Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_11_06.wav|Haven't you heard?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_11_08.wav|The Old Mine caved in, the fire mages were assassinated and there are plans to raid the Free Mine.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMINE_11_02.wav|One of the diggers who survived it told us that they were digging, and they hit an underground river on the bottom level.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMINE_11_03.wav|When the water gushed into the mine, one of the supports broke and the entire upper section collapsed.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMINE_11_04.wav|Only a handful of people managed to escape from the mine.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCKDF_11_02.wav|That's a long story.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFM_11_02.wav|That's a long story.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_02.wav|Well then. Luckily, I was in the Ore Barons' house when they got the news that the mine had collapsed.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_03.wav|Gomez was hopping mad when he heard about the accident and he was afraid that his position could be at stake.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_05.wav|That's right. Since he has no source of income any more, the goods from the outside world won't come in any more, either.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_06.wav|Nobody will work for him if he doesn't get another source of income soon.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_08.wav|To be honest, that's Gomez' only chance to maintain his power.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_11_09.wav|Two hours ago two dozen guards set out for the Free Mine.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARNNC_11_02.wav|Then you must hurry up! They'll have almost reached the Free Mine.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARNNC_11_04.wav|They don't need to get through them. A few months ago, they found a path that leads over the mountains and right to the Free Mine - and nobody else knows about it.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCGUARDS_11_02.wav|Stay away from them. They'll attack anybody approaching the Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMURDER_11_02.wav|Corristo and the other mages were the only people in the Camp to remain rational.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMURDER_11_03.wav|They forbad the raid and demanded a settlement with the two other camps.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMURDER_11_05.wav|Well, yes, Corristo and the others shouldn't have been so self-confident. Gomez didn't trust them any more and had them perfidiously assassinated.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCRETREAT_11_02.wav|We'll stay here for a while to warn some more friends so they don't bump straight into the guards.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCRETREAT_11_03.wav|But you could do us a favor.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFAVOR_11_02.wav|Look out for Lester and Gorn. They need to know what happened here.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFAVOR_11_03.wav|Tell them that the four of us will meet at the same place as always.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFAVOR_11_05.wav|Thanks, my friend. You really seem to be an alright guy. Go now, we'll meet again later.
