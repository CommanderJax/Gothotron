DUMMY/INFO_BAALLUKOR_TELEPORT_15_02.wav|And does the answer to the strange invocation of the Sleeper really lie here???
DUMMY/INFO_BAALLUKOR_TELEPORT_15_03.wav|It looks more like another burial chamber to me.

DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_KDW_15_02.wav|Gomez had them assassinated.
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_SLEEPER_15_01.wav|The so-called Sleeper is said to be an evil arch demon.
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_SLEEPER_15_02.wav|That's what the Brotherhood in the swamp found out.

DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_EVENT_15_01.wav|Why not?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_EVENT_15_03.wav|Which task?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_EVENTWHY_15_01.wav|Why have they exiled him?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_EVENTHOW_15_01.wav|What does this Orc shaman have to do with my task?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_EVENTHOW_15_03.wav|An Orc shaman is hardly likely to be keen on talking to me!

DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_01.wav|I have the answers from the Orc shaman!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_03.wav|The five Orc shamans that invoked the Sleeper built him an underground temple, its entrance is in the Orc town.
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_05.wav|Ungrateful as he was, he tore out their hearts and condemned them and the workers to an eternal existence as undead creatures!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_07.wav|The Orcs locked the temple and started making sacrifices to appease the demon!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_09.wav|Yes, there's an Orc who...
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_11.wav|I don't understand!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_RETURN_15_13.wav|That's right, but...
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_FOUNDTEMPLE_15_01.wav|I have found a way into the underground temple!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_PROPHECY_15_01.wav|Prophecies? What prophecies?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_PROPHECY_15_05.wav|I'm supposed to be the one mentioned in the ancient prophecies??? You must be wrong, surely!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_LOADSWORD_15_01.wav|I've found this strange sword.
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_LOADSWORD01_15_01.wav|URIZIEL possessed unbelievable powers?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_LOADSWORD01_15_05.wav|But they didn't hide it well enough!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_LOADSWORD02_15_01.wav|Is it possible to restore the former powers of the weapon?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_LOADSWORD02_15_03.wav|You mean strong enough to detonate the Magic Barrier with?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_01.wav|Meanwhile, I'll be hunting around for better armor!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_02.wav|These patchwork minecrawler plates have been pierced too often in the underground temple!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_03.wav|These blue rags didn't protect me well enough in the underground temple!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_04.wav|The undead have made massive dents in my armor!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_06.wav|Your old tower?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_BETTERARMOR_15_09.wav|How do I get there?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OREARMOR_15_03.wav|I found it in one of those old chests in the sunken tower.
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OREARMOR_15_05.wav|I hope it'll bring me more luck than it did him!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_FORMULA_15_01.wav|Have you completed the magic formula to reactivate URIZIEL?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_FORMULA_15_03.wav|Why not?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_FORMULA_15_05.wav|Then I'll have to look around for some support!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_ALTRUNE_15_01.wav|Since I'm a magician, it'll be hard for me to wield URIZIEL!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_SWORDLOADED_15_01.wav|I've reactivated URIZIEL!

DUMMY/DIA_TORREZ_BRIEFTAUSCH_15_02.wav|I've done that already.
DUMMY/DIA_TORREZ_BRIEFTAUSCH_15_04.wav|Here it is.
DUMMY/DIA_TORREZ_BRIEFTAUSCH_15_08.wav|Accidents happen.
DUMMY/DIA_TORREZ_PERM_15_00.wav|How's venturing in the magic arts?

DUMMY/KDF_405_TORREZ_MANA_INFO_15_01.wav|I need more magic power.
DUMMY/KDF_405_TORREZ_WANNABEMAGE_INFO_15_01.wav|What do I have to do to become a magician?
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OT_15_02.wav|How did you....
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OT_15_08.wav|I understand!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OT_15_11.wav|I've bled enough! Nobody can stop me now!
DUMMY/INFO_XARDAS_OT_15_13.wav|What's wrong with you?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_NEWS_15_01.wav|I have important news from the Brotherhood's camp!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_15_04.wav|No! Kalom has turned his back on the Brotherhood. He's taken some templars with him. Nobody knows where they've gone.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_15_06.wav|Certain events have convinced the Gurus that their way is the wrong one. Their god seems to be an evil arch demon.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_15_07.wav|One of the Gurus nearly killed me under the influence of the Sleeper, although I had saved his life just briefly beforehand.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_YBERION_15_08.wav|Cor Kalom was the only Guru who didn't want to admit the true nature of the hellish creature, that's why he's left the camp in the swamp.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BOOK_15_01.wav|I have this almanac...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BOOK_15_02.wav|Y'Berion used it to charge the focus.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_15_01.wav|I have this focus...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_15_05.wav|But won't that use up an awful lot of power?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_15_08.wav|Sounds dangerous.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FOCUS_15_10.wav|Here, take the focus. I hope it really will be of some use to your plans with the ore mound!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_WHATNOW_15_01.wav|What are you going to do with the focus and the almanac now?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_15_01.wav|I'm willing to find the four remaining focus stones for you!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_15_02.wav|After all, I'm quite keen on getting out of here sometime myself.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_OFFER_15_06.wav|Well... That's nothing unusual for me! I'll find a way to organize these things.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS2_15_01.wav|I've found a focus in the troll canyon!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS3_15_01.wav|I've found a focus in the mountain fort!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS4_15_01.wav|I've found a focus in the ruined monastery!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS4_15_02.wav|Gorn the mercenary was there, he gave me a hand in searching.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_BRINGFOCUS5_15_01.wav|I've found a focus under the ring of stone!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_15_01.wav|Can you blast the ore mound now?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ALLFOCI_15_05.wav|What can we do?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_15_01.wav|One more favor?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_15_03.wav|MAGICIANS OF FIRE??? Why should they want to give up their easy life?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_FAVOR_15_04.wav|The destruction of the Barrier would rob them of their powerful position!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_15_01.wav|Alright then, I'll try to convince the Magicians of Fire!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_ACCEPT_15_02.wav|But I can't promise anything! It seems nearly impossible to me.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_AMBUSH_15_02.wav|Let me guess, the Free Mine has been assaulted by the guards from the Old Camp. Nobody saw them coming...?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_COLLAPSE_15_01.wav|The Old Mine collapsed after water seeped in!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_MURDER_15_01.wav|Gomez has had all the Magicians of Fire killed!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_MURDER_15_03.wav|They were against the attack on the Free Mine, and opposed Gomez.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_NOMOREOC_INFO_15_01.wav|I have been exiled from the Old Camp because I have helped you!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_GOTOLEE_INFO_15_01.wav|Does that mean the mercenaries will take me on?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_15_01.wav|Does that mean that I now belong to the guild of the Magicians of the Water?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_15_03.wav|But I've already taken the oath of Fire!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_OATH_INFO_15_06.wav|Uhh... I don't understand...
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_15_01.wav|I'm ready to take the oath.

DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KDWAUFNAHME_INFO_15_11.wav|... until my body shall return to the realm of Beliar and the source of my life shall dry out.
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_LESSON_INFO_15_01.wav|Can you instruct me?
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_KREIS1_INFO_15_01.wav|I am ready to enter the First Circle.

DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_NOWSLD_15_01.wav|Lee has admitted me to the mercenaries.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_15_01.wav|When you sent me to the Magicians of Fire, you mentioned there was... SOMEBODY.
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_15_03.wav|Who is HE?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_15_06.wav|Give me the shortened version, please!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDAS_15_08.wav|A thirteenth magician? I thought there were only twelve!

DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHY_15_04.wav|What happened then?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASWHERE_15_01.wav|Where is this magician today?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASHELP_15_01.wav|I'll make my way to Xardas and ask him for help!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASHELP_15_04.wav|HE WILL!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_15_01.wav|A problem?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_15_04.wav|What does that mean?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASPROBLEM_15_07.wav|Looks like this is going to be interesting!
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_15_01.wav|How will I get past his creatures?
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_15_05.wav|I'll rummage through the library. And don't worry...
DUMMY/INFO_SATURAS_XARDASGO_15_06.wav|I'll be back!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_15_01.wav|Well...

DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_15_09.wav|The whole thing's not the way you think...
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_TIMESUP_INFO_15_11.wav|The ore mound... uh... uhm... It's grown very high!
DUMMY/KDW_600_SATURAS_HOGEAUFNAHME_15_00.wav|Nefarius said I was ready to wear the robe of a Magician of Water.

DUMMY/INFO_CRONOS_YBERION_15_01.wav|Y'Berion, the leader of the Sect Camp, is dead!
DUMMY/INFO_CRONOS_YBERION_15_03.wav|The Brotherhood performed a ritual, invoking their god.

DUMMY/DIA_VIRAN_RIPOFF_15_00.wav|I'm to take all the weeds to Cor Kalom again.
DUMMY/DIA_VIRAN_RIPOFF_15_02.wav|Now you're not going to tell me to kill all the swampsharks for you, are you? I really don't have that much time.

DUMMY/INFO_ORG_876_FIRSTWARN_INFO_15_01.wav|Why, in there.
DUMMY/INFO_ERPRESSER_CHOICE_AUFSMAUL_15_01.wav|Then why don't you come here and get your ore!
DUMMY/INFO_ERPRESSER_CHOICE_ZAHLEN_15_01.wav|Here, 10 ore.
DUMMY/INFO_ERPRESSER_CHOICE_ZAHLEN_15_03.wav|Umm... I just don't have 10 ore right now...
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_LEBEN_15_00.wav|What do you have to do as a mercenary of the magicians?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_HUT_15_00.wav|Can I stay somewhere here without having to kick somebody out of his hut?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_HUT_15_03.wav|Us?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_HUTFREE_15_00.wav|Shrike has moved to another hut.
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_BECOMESLD_15_00.wav|What do I have to do to join the New Camp?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_TRADE_15_00.wav|Have you got any more of that stuff?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_DUHEHLER_15_00.wav|Why did you take part in one of the gang's raids?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_DUHEHLER_15_02.wav|Why would you have so much of the stuff if it wasn't true?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_DUHEHLER_15_04.wav|You take part in raids regularly?
DUMMY/DIA_GORN_DUHEHLER_15_06.wav|I see.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_NCWAIT_15_03.wav|I came quite close to becoming worm food a few times, too.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_MAGES_15_01.wav|I have an important message for the Magicians of Water!
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_MAGES_15_04.wav|Can't you put in a good word for me?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_CRONOS_15_01.wav|Where can I find this 'keeper of the ore'?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINWHAT_15_01.wav|What are you doing here?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINWHAT_15_03.wav|A legend?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINFOCUS_15_02.wav|It must be somewhere in this area.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINJOIN_15_01.wav|We could go on together.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINJOIN_15_05.wav|So we'll go together?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINWALLWHAT_15_01.wav|What happens now?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINGATE_15_02.wav|And on we go, come on.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINSUCCESS_15_02.wav|Yeah. I have to take the focus to the Magicians of Water. They need it.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINTROLL_15_02.wav|Where did THAT come from?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINVICTORY_15_02.wav|Yeah, we defeated that monster. But if that was just a young troll...
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_RUINVICTORY_15_04.wav|Something like that.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_DIEGOMILTEN_15_01.wav|I met Diego and Milten in front of the Old Camp!
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_DIEGOMILTEN_15_03.wav|They want to meet you and Lester. At your usual rendezvous.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_FREEMINE_15_01.wav|What did you see in the Free Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_FREEMINE_15_05.wav|How could so many mercenaries be defeated by only two dozen guards?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_GUARDNC_15_01.wav|What have you got planned now?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_GUARDNC_15_04.wav|Are you planning a counterattack?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_GUARDNCRUNNING_15_01.wav|How's it going?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_TAKEBACK_15_01.wav|You're planning to retake it with just four men? Where are all the mercenaries?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_SECOND_15_01.wav|The first step? What will be the second?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_SECOND_15_04.wav|I see.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_WHYME_15_01.wav|Why me, of all people?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_KICKBUTT_15_01.wav|Okay, let's go and teach the unwelcome guests in the mine a lesson!
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_MYWAY_15_01.wav|Why not. I need to get into the mine anyway!
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_WOLF_15_04.wav|He can wait, we have more important things to do.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_WOLF_15_06.wav|Then I'd better go there now.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_FMGATE_15_02.wav|An old acquaintance... But that account is settled.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_AFTERFM_15_03.wav|The main thing is that we've driven them out of our mine again.
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_FMWATCH_15_01.wav|How's the situation?
DUMMY/INFO_GORN_FOUNDULUMULU_15_03.wav|It's an Orcish symbol for friendship. I want to enter the Orc town with it.
DUMMY/INFO_GORNFM_WAIT_15_01.wav|Hold the position, I'll check the situation!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNFM_FOLLOW_15_01.wav|Come on, I need your help.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_15_00.wav|I have a letter for the High Magician of the Circle of Fire.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_GIVE_15_00.wav|Here it is.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_15_02.wav|Yes. A magician gave me the letter shortly before they threw me into the colony.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_GIVE_15_04.wav|What's so exciting about that?
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_NO_15_00.wav|I want my reward first.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_NO_AGAIN_15_00.wav|I'd rather give the letter to Torrez himself.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_LETTER_NO_AGAIN_15_02.wav|No. I want to see my reward first.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_WOTORREZ_15_00.wav|Where can I find Torrez?
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_NOCHEINBRIEF_15_00.wav|I have a letter from the Magicians of Water.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_PERM_15_00.wav|Tell me something about the Magicians of Fire.
DUMMY/DIA_MILTEN_WANNAMAGE_15_00.wav|I want to become a magician's apprentice, too. Just like you.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHWAIT_15_03.wav|I do my best.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHGORN_15_01.wav|I met Gorn.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHGORN_15_03.wav|By the old ruined monastery by the sea. The two of us searched it for treasures.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHLESTER_15_01.wav|Lester and I took out the mountain fort.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHLESTER_15_03.wav|Where have the four of you been meeting so far?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHYOU_15_01.wav|What are you doing here?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHYOU_15_03.wav|Some sort of tomb?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHME_15_01.wav|I'm looking for a focus stone. It must be here somewhere.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHPROBLEM_15_01.wav|Why don't you go down into the tomb and get what you're looking for?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHPROBLEM_15_03.wav|Go ahead, I'm in no hurry.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHFOCUS_15_01.wav|Is this artefact one of the five focus stones?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHFOCUS_15_03.wav|Don't tell me you're after the focus as well!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHSEAL_15_01.wav|The artefact was sealed away?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHSEAL_15_04.wav|How can you get past that curse?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHTALISMAN_15_01.wav|What about that talisman?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER_15_01.wav|We should seek out the tomb together! You get the talisman, and I'll have the focus stone.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER_15_03.wav|A problem?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER_15_05.wav|Can't he be cut into handy little pieces?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER_15_07.wav|Let me guess, you already got a plan, right?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER2_15_01.wav|Tell me!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHOFFER2_15_04.wav|Then it should be child's play to take out the tomb.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHACCEPT_15_01.wav|Give me the spell scroll and we'll do it together!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHACCEPT_15_05.wav|I see. Well, which way leads to the ring of stone?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHARRIVED_15_02.wav|Then let's go and visit the guard!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHHEAL_15_01.wav|I'm wounded. Please help me.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHRUNNING_15_01.wav|The guard's still alive!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHSCROLL_15_01.wav|I used the spell scroll - but not on the guard!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHNEWSCROLL_15_01.wav|I have a new 'Death to the Undead' spell scroll!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHCONTINUE_15_01.wav|Shall we dare to have another go at the guard?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_SHSUCCESS_15_02.wav|Here, take it. That was our deal!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWARN_15_02.wav|Calm down, Milten, I've already met Diego on the other side of the Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWARN_15_04.wav|If I can find Gorn and Lester, I'll warn them and send them to your meeting place.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWARN_15_06.wav|Calm down, Milten, what happened?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWARN_15_08.wav|You'd better tell me the whole story from the beginning, one thing after the other.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWARN_15_11.wav|The Old Mine CAVED IN???
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCMINE_15_01.wav|How could the mine cave in?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCMINE_15_03.wav|Were you there?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCKDW_15_01.wav|What was that you said about the Magicians of Fire?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCWHY_15_01.wav|Why would the Ore Barons want to kill the magicians? It doesn't make sense...
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCYOU_15_01.wav|You should hide. Far away from here.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_OCDIEGO_15_01.wav|Where can I find Diego?
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD_15_02.wav|Hello, Milten. A lot has happened since we met the last time.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD_15_03.wav|I would like to tell you everything but I don't have the time right now. I'm in a hurry.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD1_15_01.wav|Milten, I need your help!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD1_15_03.wav|Let's go somewhere where we can talk.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSAWAY_15_02.wav|I need the magic powers of the ore mound and I don't think it would be a good move to ask the other Magicians of Water.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSAWAY_15_04.wav|This is no time for jokes. I'm deadly serious.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSAWAY_15_05.wav|I've seen Xardas, the Necromancer!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSAWAY_15_06.wav|I'm working under his orders!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSAWAY_15_11.wav|I want to transfer them to this sword here.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD4_15_01.wav|Xardas gave me this magic spell to carry out the transfer!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LOADSWORD4_15_02.wav|You will have to recite it while I bring the sword and the ore together!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSRISK_15_01.wav|We'll have to take that risk!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSRISK_15_02.wav|It really is VERY, VERY important!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSRISK_15_03.wav|Important for ALL inhabitants of the colony.
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSRISK_15_05.wav|It will get us out of here! You have to trust me!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSRISK_15_09.wav|Good, let's meet at the ore mound! See you there!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSNOW_15_01.wav|Here, take the spell!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSNOW_15_04.wav|Then let's do it!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSDONE_15_02.wav|Unbelievable! The plain gray gem is shimmering bluish now!
DUMMY/INFO_MILTEN_LSDONE_15_06.wav|What about you?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_HALLO_15_00.wav|Who are you?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_WANNATALKTOMASTER_15_00.wav|But I want to talk to your master.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_CAMPINFO_15_00.wav|Tell me something about the Camp.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_CAMPINFO_GIL_15_00.wav|Tell me about the guilds.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_CAMPINFO_SLEEPER_15_00.wav|What can you tell me about the Sleeper?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_CAMPINFO_SLEEPER_15_03.wav|And you believe that?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_CAMPINFO_HERB_15_00.wav|What do you know about the weed?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_WANNAJOIN_15_00.wav|I want to become a member of the Brotherhood!
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_HOWPROOFWORTHY_15_00.wav|How's that supposed to work if none of the Gurus will talk to me?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_WEITWEG_15_00.wav|How can I get your master to talk to me?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_WEITWEG_15_02.wav|And that is?
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_WEITWEG_15_08.wav|No problem.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_SHOW_15_00.wav|I HAVE RENOUNCED THE OLD GODS.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_SHOW_15_02.wav|I HAD A VISION: THE SLEEPER TALKED TO ME.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_SHOW_15_04.wav|HE SAID: GO TO THE CAMP IN THE SWAMP AND JOIN THE BROOTHERHOOD.
DUMMY/DIA_LESTER_GUIDEOFFER_15_00.wav|How can I find my way around here in the Camp?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_SOON_INFO_15_01.wav|Are we nearly there yet?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_CHANGE_INFO_15_01.wav|I've changed my mind.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_GUIDEFIRST_INFO_15_01.wav|Show me the way...
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_GUIDEFIRST_SMITH_INFO_15_01.wav|... to the blacksmith shop.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_GUIDEFIRST_TEMPEL_INFO_15_01.wav|... to the temple.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_GUIDEFIRST_TRAIN_INFO_15_01.wav|... to the tutors.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_GUIDEFIRST_HERB_INFO_15_01.wav|... to the alchemy lab!
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_SEND_INFO_15_01.wav|Good news, I hope.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_SEND_INFO_15_03.wav|What are you planning? To break out?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_SEND_INFO_15_05.wav|Oh, and?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_BROTHERHOOD_TODO_15_01.wav|What's that got to do with me?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_BROTHERHOOD_TODO_15_03.wav|Where do I find him?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_FOLLOWME_INFO_15_02.wav|I came here by order of the Magicians of Water. I'm looking for magical artefacts, so-called focus stones.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_FOLLOWME_INFO_15_04.wav|Saturas and the other magicians from the New Camp want to use it to detonate the Barrier in order to free us from this imprisonment.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_FOLLOWME_INFO_15_06.wav|I feel the same. But tell me, why did you come here?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_NORMAL_INFO_15_01.wav|How did you manage to get past that living mountain?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_STORY_INFO_15_01.wav|This document you're looking for... what is it?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_STORY_INFO_15_04.wav|But as long as we are being kept in here by the Barrier, it won't be worth anything.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_COMEWITHME_INFO_15_01.wav|We could have a look around the fort together!
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_FOKUSPLACE_INFO_15_02.wav|Right, looks like a focus platform, hm... It's not that easy to reach it...
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_IAMHURT_INFO_15_01.wav|I'm injured. Can you help me?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_URKUNDE_INFO_15_01.wav|I've found the document.
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_TIP_INFO_15_01.wav|How can I reach the focus?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_CHESTCLOSED_INFO_15_01.wav|Have you found anything?
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_CHESTCLOSED_INFO_15_04.wav|No, not yet...
DUMMY/PC_PSIONIC_COMEAGAIN_INFO_15_01.wav|Let's sound out the fort together.
DUMMY/INFO_LESTER_DIEGOMILTEN_15_01.wav|They want to meet you. At your usual rendezvous.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_EXIT_GAMESTART_15_00.wav|Thanks for your help.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_EXIT_15_00.wav|Take care.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_15_00.wav|I have a letter for the High Magician of the Circle of Fire.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_15_02.wav|I was given it by a mage shortly before they threw me in here.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRIEF_15_06.wav|Why not?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_15_00.wav|Why did you help me?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WARUMGEHOLFEN_15_03.wav|A suggestion...
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BULLIT_15_02.wav|Where's Bullit now?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_KOLONIE_15_00.wav|Okay, what do I need to know about this place?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_15_00.wav|Tell me more about the Barrier.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_15_02.wav|What happens if I just walk out of here?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BARRIERE_15_04.wav|If there's a way out, I'll find it.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OTHERCAMPS_15_00.wav|What about the two other camps?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OLDCAMP_15_00.wav|Tell me something about the Old Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WHOSGOMEZ_15_00.wav|Who's Gomez?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINOLDCAMP_15_00.wav|Let's assume I want to join his people, what do I need to do?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WAYTOOLDCAMP_15_00.wav|How do I get to the Old Camp?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WOWAFFE_15_00.wav|Where do I get a weapon?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_THORUSSAYS_15_00.wav|I've talked to Thorus.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_THORUSSAYS_15_02.wav|He says that I can join the Old Camp if YOU think that I'm good enough.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_THORUSSAYS_15_04.wav|Do we start right now?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_RULES_15_00.wav|What do I have to know to be accepted in the Old Camp?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_CELEBS_15_00.wav|Where do I find the important people?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACHERS_15_00.wav|Who can teach me?

DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_TEACH_15_00.wav|Can you teach me something?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_15_00.wav|What's the test of faith?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_OFFER_15_04.wav|No problem!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_IANPASSWORD_INFO_15_01.wav|If the list is so important, why should Ian give it to ME?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_IANPASSWORD_INFO_15_03.wav|I'll tell him.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_MAPTOOLDMINE_INFO_15_00.wav|Where can I find the Old Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_BRINGLIST_SUCCESS_15_00.wav|I have the list from Ian.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_15_00.wav|What about my esteem within the Camp?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_JOINANALYZE_15_02.wav|And?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_WHATTOSAYTOGOMEZ_INFO_15_00.wav|What do I have to do when I meet Gomez?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_ARMOR_INFO_15_01.wav|Can I have an armor like yours?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_15_01.wav|Sometimes I thought so myself.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_15_03.wav|Obviously you're quite well informed.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_15_05.wav|Yes. There must be one somewhere around here.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_15_07.wav|I see. What do you want?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_MEETAGAIN_INFO_15_09.wav|No? What's the problem then?
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_SHOWFOCUS_INFO_15_02.wav|Alright. But first we have to get rid of that monster over there.
DUMMY/PC_THIEF_GOTIT_INFO_15_03.wav|Make sure you stay alive!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_15_02.wav|Hello, Diego, I've already talked to Milten on the other side of the Camp!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_15_05.wav|Hello, Diego, what's the meaning of all this hide-and-seek business?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_15_07.wav|Heard what?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARN_15_09.wav|WHAAAT???? What are you talking about?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMINE_15_01.wav|How could the Old Mine cave in?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCKDF_15_01.wav|Why are the fire mages dead?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFM_15_01.wav|A raid on the Free Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_15_01.wav|Just tell me about it! It's not the first long story I've had to listen to!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_15_04.wav|Of course. Who controls the ore controls the colony as well!
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCSTORY_15_07.wav|And that's the reason for the raid on the Free Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARNNC_15_01.wav|That's mad! I need to warn the New Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCWARNNC_15_03.wav|But they never get through the fortifications of the New Camp.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCGUARDS_15_01.wav|I've seen the guards in front of the locked gates.
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMURDER_15_01.wav|But what happened to the fire mages?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCMURDER_15_04.wav|They FORBADE Gomez to raid the Free Mine?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCRETREAT_15_01.wav|What are you and Milten going to do now?
DUMMY/INFO_DIEGO_OCFAVOR_15_01.wav|Consider it done. Tell me what you want!

DUMMY/INFO_SWINEY_PERM_15_00.wav|How much ore have you collected so far?
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_GREET_15_00.wav|You're the boss of the mercenaries, aren't you?
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_DEFINE_15_00.wav|Which tasks do the mages' mercenaries have?
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_MITMACHEN_15_00.wav|I'd like to join you!

DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_FREEDOM_15_01.wav|I wanted freedom from the very beginning.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_JUSTBECAUSE_15_01.wav|It just sort of happened that way.
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_FMTAKEN_15_00.wav|What do you think about the mine?
DUMMY/INFO_LEE_NOW_FREEMINEFREE_15_01.wav|They shouldn't be a threat anymore!
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_CHANGESIDE_INFO_15_01.wav|The Old Camp has banned me, I'd like to join you!
