DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_1_MINE_01_02.wav|The crawler's don't taste too good either. What a shithole.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_1_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_01_01.wav|Ian's the boss of the mine. He organizes the workforce and the exchange of goods with the Camp. If you want anything, you'd better talk to him.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_1_MINECRAWLER_01_01.wav|The templars made a deal with Gomez. They kill the crawlers, they get to keep the beasts' mandibles.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_1_DIELAGE_01_01.wav|A lot of work, not much rest. So be quick with your questions. I have work to do.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_MINE_01_01.wav|There's a lot of caves where there's still some ore left. But the crawlers just make it impossible to work in them.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_MINE_01_02.wav|Too many attacks, too many losses.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_01_01.wav|Viper's the smelter. He knows all about the oven, he has a body like iron. He don't mind the heat. He spends all day melting the ore.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_MINECRAWLER_01_01.wav|We had to close down the big pit at the bottom. It's overrun with minecrawlers.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_MINECRAWLER_01_02.wav|There are minecrawlers all over the place. Can't you hear 'em? I sure can!
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_2_DIELAGE_01_01.wav|I have to work. If the guards catch me standing around talking, they'll cut my rations.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_MINE_01_01.wav|We all have to work hard for weeks on end, we never get to see the light of day. There is no escape. The only way out is death.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_01_01.wav|Ian's the boss of the mine. Asghan's in charge of the guards.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_MINECRAWLER_01_01.wav|You mean what's the best way of dealin' with crawlers? Run. Run as fast as your legs will carry you.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_MINECRAWLER_01_02.wav|If you go missing, it's too late. Not that anyone's likely to miss you.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_DIELAGE_01_01.wav|Well, my back aches, my arms feel like they're gonna drop off, my tongue's bone dry and I'm dead tired.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_3_DIELAGE_01_02.wav|And the constant hammering of the pickaxes is slowly driving me round the bend.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_4_MINE_01_01.wav|Pickaxes and sweat. That's what you get in here. You come, you go.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_4_MINE_01_02.wav|But, when you're long gone, I'll still be here, hewing the ore from the rock. That's my job, and my life.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_4_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_01_01.wav|Santino and Alberto swap goods for the ore that we dig. They give us our daily rations.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_4_MINECRAWLER_01_01.wav|If you see one of them crawler scum, whack it between the eyes with your pickaxe. But you have to take good aim, you won't get no second chance.
DUMMY/INFO_MINE_VLK_4_DIELAGE_01_01.wav|I've been better.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_1_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_01_01.wav|That's simple. Grab a pickaxe and get in the mine. Half of your ore gets spent for protection, and the rest will just about enable you to survive.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_1_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_01_01.wav|The Ore Barons. They organize the exchange of ore with the King. The more important you are, the more you get.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_1_DASLAGER_01_01.wav|Well, you can go to the arena in the evenings and watch the guards puttin' each others faces out of joint.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_1_DASLAGER_01_02.wav|It is really worth the entrance fee.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_1_DIELAGE_01_01.wav|I've spent the last two weeks working in the mine. All I want is peace. Get out of my sight.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_02_01.wav|I can't understand why you'd wanna volunteer to work in the mines. Guys like you are more likely to be living in the castle soon.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_02_01.wav|Here in the outer ring, Fletcher, Bloodwyn and Jackal collect the protection money. They run a district each.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_02_02.wav|If you get on the right side of them, you're okay.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_DASLAGER_02_01.wav|You should talk to the Shadows. They can tell you all you need to know. Be careful, though, you can't trust most of them.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_DIELAGE_02_01.wav|If you've been sent by the Ore Barons, tell 'em I don't want no trouble. I'm not talking to anybody.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_DIELAGE_02_02.wav|I'm satisfied with what they give us.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_2_DIELAGE_02_04.wav|A new one, uh? Newcomers always get into trouble pretty quick. I don't wanna get involved, okay?
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_03_01.wav|I'm just a digger. I don't have no say in the matter. You should talk to the guards or the Shadows.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_03_01.wav|Gomez. He lives in the castle. But we diggers have enough to worry about with the guards.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_03_02.wav|It's best if you just keep out of their way. If you don't, you have a problem.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_DASLAGER_03_01.wav|Well, if you like to gamble, you have to go to the arena in the evenings. If you want to buy things, go to the market place.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_DASLAGER_03_02.wav|They sell practically everything there. Except maps. You want maps, you'd better go and see Graham. His hut's the one just opposite the castle gate.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_3_DIELAGE_03_02.wav|I haven't slept properly for days. And if you don't sleep in this colony, then you're doing double time!
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_04_01.wav|Chin up, boy.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_04_04.wav|You mean as a Shadow or a guard? That won't be easy, man. You'll have to pass a few tests before old Thorus'll let you see Gomez.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_04_02.wav|And you'll have to get on the right side of people here. But as long as you don't belong to any camp, nobody's gonna take you seriously.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_EINERVONEUCHWERDEN_04_03.wav|If I were you, I'd have a word with some of the Shadows. Maybe you'll find one of them who's willing to help you. If you offer them something in return, that is.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_04_01.wav|Being new, you'd better make sure you don't fall out with Gravo. He may only be a digger, but he knows how to deal with the Ore Barons.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_WICHTIGEPERSONEN_04_02.wav|If you get into trouble with Gomez' bunch, he can help you get out of it.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_DASLAGER_04_01.wav|Unless you fancy digging in the mines, you should hang around in between the northern gate and the castle gate.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_DASLAGER_04_02.wav|If you're lucky, Thorus or Diego might give you something to do for them - that'll give you a chance to get on the right side of them. It can't hurt to get in with Gomez' people.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_DASLAGER_04_03.wav|Or you might meet a mage. They sometimes ask folks to do errands for 'em. And they pay well.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_DASLAGER_04_05.wav|What do I know. Ask the folks that live there.
DUMMY/INFO_VLK_4_DIELAGE_04_01.wav|As okay as I was 20 years ago. Nothing much has changed since then.
DUMMY/DIA_VLK_520_LEAVEME_01_01.wav|I want to be left in peace - so get lost!
DUMMY/DIA_VLK_534_LEAVEME_02_01.wav|I'm waiting for a friend to return from the mine. He owes me some ore.
DUMMY/DIA_VLK_534_LEAVEME_02_02.wav|I can't turn up in the Camp without the ore - I couldn't pay the protection money for the guards and then things will get real heavy for me.
