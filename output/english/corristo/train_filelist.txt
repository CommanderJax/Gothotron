DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINMAGE_INFO_14_03.wav|Our magic is a gift from the gods. We've been chosen to act as priests, tutors and judges.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINMAGE_INFO_14_04.wav|It is a gift which is a constant burden to us. A task which determines our lives.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_WANNBEKDF_INFO_14_02.wav|So you want to become a Magician of the Circle of Fire? Hm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_WANNBEKDF_INFO_14_04.wav|You are not ready yet. Come back when you've learned more.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_WANNBEKDF_INFO_14_05.wav|Your spirit is mature and ready to join us. If you want to become a magician, I must test you first. Let me know when you're ready for the test.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_INFO_14_02.wav|Good. You have served the Brotherhood in the swamp, have you not?
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_JA_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_JA_INFO_14_03.wav|What is the name of our god?
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_NO_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_NO_INFO_14_03.wav|We have no use for a man who denies his deeds.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_NO_INFO_14_04.wav|Make yourself useful as a fighter or digger. The path of magic will remain forever closed to you.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_ADANOS_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_ADANOS_INFO_14_03.wav|That is incorrect. Maybe the Guards can make use of you.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_SLEEPER_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_SLEEPER_INFO_14_03.wav|Looks like you've been spending too much time among the swamp brothers. Maybe you'd better stay there.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_INNOS_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_INNOS_INFO_14_03.wav|Which is the highest virtue of all?
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_GOMEZ_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_GOMEZ_INFO_14_03.wav|I believe the Guards would be just right for you! Speak to Thorus!
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_FIGHT_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_FIGHT_INFO_14_03.wav|I believe the Guards would be just right for you! Speak to Thorus!
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DEMUT_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DEMUT_INFO_14_03.wav|You have replied well and rightly. I shall teach you the art of magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DEMUT_INFO_14_04.wav|Follow me to the Hall of Magic, where you will take the ancient vow.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DISZIPLIN_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DISZIPLIN_INFO_14_03.wav|You have replied well and rightly. I shall teach you the art of magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_DISZIPLIN_INFO_14_04.wav|Follow me to the Hall of Magic, where you will take the ancient vow.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_EHRFURCHT_INFO_14_02.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_EHRFURCHT_INFO_14_03.wav|You have replied well and rightly. I shall teach you the art of magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KDFTEST_EHRFURCHT_INFO_14_04.wav|Follow me to the Hall of Magic, where you will take the ancient vow.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_01.wav|We are gathered here today to ordain a servant of Fire.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_02.wav|Now take the oath of Fire.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_03.wav|I swear by the might of the gods...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_05.wav|... I swear by the force of the holy Fire...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_07.wav|... that my knowledge and my deeds from now on and forever shall be one with the flame...
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_AUFNAHME_INFO_14_09.wav|... until my body shall return to the realm of Beliar and the fire of my life be extinguished.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_ROBE_INFO_14_01.wav|By uttering the words of the oath you have now entered into a bond with the Fire.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_ROBE_INFO_14_02.wav|Wear this robe as a sign of the eternal bond.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_MANA_INFO_14_02.wav|I can help you to increase your power. What use you make of it is your affair.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_02.wav|Of course. The Circles symbolize your share of the magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_03.wav|They stand for knowledge, skill and the learning of new magic spells.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_04.wav|You must pass through each Circle before you can join the next.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_06.wav|But your efforts to reach them will be rewarded with new and powerful spells each time. However, the Circles of magic are more than that.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_07.wav|They are part of your life. They will always be with you. Make them part of you.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_EXPLAINCIRCLES_INFO_14_08.wav|To understand their might, you need to recognize your own.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_02.wav|To enter the first of the magic Circles means learning to use magic runes.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_03.wav|Each rune contains the structure of a special magic spell.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_04.wav|By using your own magic powers, you'll be able to cast the magic of the rune.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_05.wav|But in contrast to the magic scrolls, which are magic formulas as well, the magic power of the rune ensures that the structure of the spell endures.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_06.wav|Every rune is a source of magic power which you can fall back on anytime.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_07.wav|Your own magic power is used up when you use a rune, just as with a spell scroll.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS1_INFO_14_09.wav|Use the power of the runes to recognize yourself.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_02.wav|You have learned to understand the runes. Now is the time to deepen this understanding.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_03.wav|When you join the Second Circle you will learn the foundations of stronger battle spells, and above all the secret of healing.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_04.wav|But you need to learn much if you want to recognize the true secrets of magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_05.wav|You know that you can use every rune as often as you like until you've used up all of your own powers.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_06.wav|But before you act, think about the point of your actions. You have obtained powers with which you may easily conjure up death and destruction.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_07.wav|But a true magician only uses magic when it is necessary.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS2_INFO_14_08.wav|Understand the situation, then you'll recognize the power of the runes.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_02.wav|The Third Circle of Magic is one of the most important steps in the life of a magician. Once you've reached it, you cease to be a seeker.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_03.wav|You have already come far on the path of magic. You have learned to use the runes.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_04.wav|This knowledge is the foundation for your further path. Use the runes with deliberation.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_05.wav|You may use a rune or not. But you must decide on one of these possibilities.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_06.wav|Do not hesitate to use your powers as soon as you've made your choice.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS3_INFO_14_07.wav|Understand your path, then you'll recognize the power of the decision.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_02.wav|You have completed the first three Circles. Now is the time for you to learn the secrets of magic.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_03.wav|The magic of the runes is based on the stone. They are magic stones, created out of magic ore.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_04.wav|It's the same ore which is collected in the mines. This ore is endowed with magic formulas in the temples. There the runes are converted to the instruments of our power.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_05.wav|With the runes you control now, you have the entire knowledge of the temples of the realm at your fingertips.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_06.wav|You have now learned everything I can teach you.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_KREIS4_INFO_14_07.wav|Understand the magic, then you'll discover the secret of power.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_HEAVYARMOR_INFO_14_03.wav|You don't own enough ore.
DUMMY/KDF_402_CORRISTO_HEAVYARMOR_INFO_14_04.wav|The time has come. You are worthy of wearing the high robe of Fire.
