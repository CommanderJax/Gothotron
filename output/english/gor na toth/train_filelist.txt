DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_11_00.wav|Cor Angar has spoken to you? What did he say?
DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_NORMAL_11_01.wav|It would appear he has a high opinion of you. He never speaks to anybody.
DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_NORMAL_11_02.wav|It is an honor even to be noticed by him. The last time he spoke to ME was about two months ago.
DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_SHARK_11_01.wav|What...? A holy task is waiting for me!
DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_SHARK_11_02.wav|My master's wish is my command.
DUMMY/DIA_GORNATOTH_ANGARTALKED_UNWORTHY_11_01.wav|Never! He could not have said that! Not about ME!
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_GETSTUFF_INFO_11_02.wav|I'm delighted to have the honor of handing our armor to the man who found the minecrawler eggs.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_GETSTUFF_INFO_11_03.wav|May this armor protect you, as the Sleeper protects the Brotherhood!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_11_02.wav|I could give you better armor, but you must make a generous contribution to the Brotherhood!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_M_11_02.wav|You're not experienced enough! Prove your worth as a templar, then you'll earn the right to wear better armor.
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_M_11_03.wav|As soon as you are able to make a sufficient donation to our community, you shall have better armor!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_M_11_04.wav|Now that you're able to make the donation, you'll be protected by new armor.
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_H_11_02.wav|You're not experienced enough! Prove your worth as a member of our community, then you'll be allowed to wear such exquisite armor.
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_H_11_03.wav|Meanwhile, you have earned the right to wear such armor, but at the moment you're not able to make the sufficient donation to the community!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_H_11_04.wav|From now on, wear this armor as a sign of the highest honor!
DUMMY/INFO_GORNATOTH_ARMOR_BACK_11_02.wav|Whatever you want. You know where to find me!
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TEACH_11_01.wav|Strength and dexterity are as important as the power of the mind.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_01.wav|That's a good decision! Before you can improve your technique, you'll have to learn how to hold the weapon right.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_02.wav|Beginners often tend to hold one-handed weapons with both hands. Now, you'd better not even start getting into that habit, it'll only get in the way.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_03.wav|Hold the weapon with one hand, blade up, and keep swinging it.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_04.wav|You have to learn to harmonize your weapon's swing with your own movements. That'll make you faster in the attack.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_05.wav|If you keep in mind what I've taught you, your fights will be more elegant and a lot faster in future.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_06.wav|Oh yeah, one more thing: Some hits cause more damage than others! As a beginner, you don't stand much of a chance of making critical hits.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAIN_11_07.wav|But the further you progress, the better you get.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAINAGAIN_INFO_11_02.wav|Okay, you know the basics. Holding the weapon lower down will let you put more force into your first strike.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAINAGAIN_INFO_11_03.wav|Use the swing, remember? Okay, now you need to use your body more. When you've struck twice, spin around. That'll confuse the opponent and put you in an excellent position.
DUMMY/TPL_1402_GORNATOTH_TRAINAGAIN_INFO_11_05.wav|And back to the front. Don't forget: practice makes perfect. So, get going and become a real master of the art of one-handed fighting.
