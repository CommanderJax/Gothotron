DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_FIRST_13_02.wav|Then watch out! The outside world is pretty dangerous. You're only safe inside a camp.
DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_DUSTY_ZOLL_13_00.wav|Stop! Where d'you think you're going with our friend?
DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_DUSTY_ZOLL_PISSOFF_13_00.wav|I disagree!
DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_DUSTY_ZOLL_TOPSI_13_00.wav|Well, you ain't gonna get there...
DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_DUSTY_ZOLL_LITTLEWALK_13_00.wav|I never saw anything.
DUMMY/DIA_GRD_216_DUSTY_ZOLL_LITTLEWALK_13_02.wav|Are you having me on? You won't get off that easy, kid!
DUMMY/GRD_216_TORWACHE_SEETHORUS_INFO_13_01.wav|Hey, I'm glad you showed up. Thorus wants to see you!
DUMMY/GRD_216_TORWACHE_SEETHORUS_INFO_13_03.wav|Why, I'm sure he'll tell you soon enough.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_HELLO_03_01.wav|Go away! I've been working my ass off in the mines for the last two weeks. And what for?
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_HELLO_03_02.wav|Some sad lumps of ore is all I got. I had to spend most of it on food.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_HELLO_03_04.wav|I think I'd better go there instead of slaving away for Gomez.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_WHYNOTLEAVE_03_01.wav|Because I'm not quite sure what to expect there. I had a pal here - his name was Melvin. He headed off to the Sect Camp a week ago.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_WHYNOTLEAVE_03_02.wav|But since then I haven't heard of him. And as long as I don't get a message from him, I'll stay here!
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_METMELVIN_03_01.wav|And? What did he say?
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_METMELVIN_03_03.wav|Hey man! He has all the fun for himself? I have to go there. But I'll never make it out of the Camp.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_METMELVIN_03_05.wav|The guards have found out that I wanna leave, I guess I talk too much.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_METMELVIN_03_06.wav|I need at least 100 ore to bribe the guards.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_OFFER100ORE_03_01.wav|You'd do that? Why?
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_OFFER100ORE_03_03.wav|You mean you wanna come with me?
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_IWOULDGO_03_01.wav|Great, man! I'm ready. We can start as soon as you want.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_IWOULDGO_03_02.wav|But don't forget - we need 100 ore for the guards.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_LETSGO_03_01.wav|Okay - let's take the south gate - the north gate is of no use, it's impossible to bribe the guards there.
DUMMY/DIA_DUSTY_LETSGO_03_02.wav|And perhaps you should see to the ore - I'm not very good at that kind of thing.
