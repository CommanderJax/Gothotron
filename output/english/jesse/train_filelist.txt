DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_WARN_03_00.wav|Hey, you! I learned you didn't want to pay protection money to Bloodwyn?
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_WARN_03_02.wav|To warn you! Bloodwyn paid some people: They're gonna do you in.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_WARN_03_03.wav|I saw how he talked to people like Herek over there, and God knows who else he hired!
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_WARN_03_05.wav|He must have talked to somebody else as well, that much I know. So do take care.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_03_01.wav|Because favors can be returned. And you don't look like somebody who wouldn't understand that.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_03_02.wav|And because I did YOU a favor, I'd like to give you the opportunity to return it.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_FORGETIT_03_01.wav|Oh! Then get lost!
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_WHAT_03_01.wav|I don't have any ore left, and Bloodwyn has already fleeced me as well.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_WHAT_03_02.wav|Now that I've helped you, you could give him the 10 ore I owe him, couldn't you? Tell him it's from me.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_YES_03_01.wav|Thanks, man! You just saved my day! Tell me when things are settled, will you?
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSION_NO_03_01.wav|Apparently I was wrong about you. Don't count on me in the future.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSUCCESS_03_01.wav|Yeah? Great! Then we're quits now.
DUMMY/DIA_JESSE_MISSUCCESS_WAAAS_03_01.wav|Apparently.
