DUMMY/DIA_LEE_GREET_08_01.wav|That's right, boy!
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_DEFINE_08_01.wav|Very simple: Protect the ore - protect the mages.
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_DEFINE_08_02.wav|Sometimes the mages have a special task for one of us.
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_MITMACHEN_08_02.wav|You can only become one of us after you spent a certain time in the Camp. I'll observe you!
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLD_INFO_08_01.wav|Your deeds for the people in the Old Mine have demonstrated that you're quite a good man.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLD_INFO_08_02.wav|I'd be willing to let you join the mercenaries.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLD_INFO_08_03.wav|But you're not ready for the mercenaries yet. Just collect some more experience and you'll be there.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLD_INFO_08_04.wav|Ich gebe dir eine Chance. Wie siehts aus?
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_NOWREADY_08_01.wav|You still don't have enough experience. You need to improve your abilities.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_INFO_08_02.wav|A good decision. You won't regret it.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_INFO_08_03.wav|Tell me something: Why? Why have you joined us and not the Old Camp or the Brotherhood?
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_NOOTHER_08_02.wav|The only thing that's worth anything in here is the hope of freedom. Welcome, MERCENARY!
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_FREEDOM_08_02.wav|We'll get our freedom back. Welcome, MERCENARY.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_BECOMESLDNOW_JUSTBECAUSE_08_02.wav|I only hope it doesn't just sort of happen that we stay trapped in here forever. Welcome, MERCENARY.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_01.wav|There was a time when I led a very different life.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_02.wav|I was one of the best generals of this country.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_03.wav|I've spent my whole life fighting for my country.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_04.wav|But the nobles didn't like me, because the King listened to my advice. And they knew I posed a threat to their dirty business.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_05.wav|I hadn't counted on their insidiousness. They used the King's wife to get me.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_06.wav|I was blamed for her pointless murder. King Rhobar had no other choice.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_07.wav|The services I had rendered my country saved me from the gallows. But they robbed me of my freedom.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_08.wav|One day I'll be free again. Then I shall return and take revenge.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_DAMNPAST_INFO_08_09.wav|I shall have my revenge.
DUMMY/DIA_LEE_FMTAKEN_08_01.wav|They've gone too far, they'll be sorry for it.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_CHANGESIDE_INFO_08_02.wav|You've done much for our camp. I can make good use of men like you.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_CHANGESIDE_INFO_08_03.wav|Let's keep it short. Welcome to the New Camp, MERCENARY!
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_CHANGESIDE_INFO_08_04.wav|Here take some armor. Good that you're here with us.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_INFO_08_02.wav|You'll first have to earn your armor. Apart from that they don't come cheap.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_M_INFO_08_02.wav|You're not experienced enough to wear better armor. Come back as soon as you've gained more experience.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_M_INFO_08_04.wav|This armor is a good piece of work. It'll protect your body well.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_H_INFO_08_02.wav|You're not experienced enough to wear the heavy armor. Come back as soon as you've gained more experience.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_H_INFO_08_03.wav|Without ore you won't get armor either.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ARMOR_H_INFO_08_04.wav|This armor is the best piece you'll ever get inside the Barrier. And believe me, it's worth the ore.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_TEACH_08_01.wav|I can help you to get stronger and more dexterous.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_02.wav|Okay, let's go through the basics first.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_03.wav|Hold the sword in a horizontal position. You'll need a great swing to attack your opponent with such a heavy weapon.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_04.wav|Raise your arm and swing it straight down. That's usually enough to knock the opponent down.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_05.wav|Use the momentum of the weapon to bring it straight back up again.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_06.wav|Two-handed swords are ideal for coordinating side hits to keep the opponents at a distance.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_08_07.wav|That should do to begin with. Have a practice.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_02.wav|First of all, you need to change your basic stance. Hold the sword vertically, grasp the hilt firmly in both hands and hold it at the side of your body.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_03.wav|Bring it down quickly and swing the blade over your shoulder. Now's your chance to do a quick slash to your right.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_04.wav|Your opponent won't stand a chance of coming at you.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_05.wav|Or bring the sword down from the top left in a forward thrust to drive your opponent back.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_06.wav|Spin round to give your next blow the necessary momentum to strike your opponent down.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_07.wav|If it isn't enough, use your remaining swing to wield the sword again.
DUMMY/SLD_700_LEE_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_08_08.wav|When you've finished your attack, block your opponent and wait for an opening to strike again.
