DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_FIRST_07_00.wav|Hey! Just arrived? We need somebody to take some water to the peasants in the rice fields.
DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_FIRST_07_01.wav|This way you can make friends with a few people. What do you think?
DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_FIRST_YES_07_01.wav|Great! Go to the Rice Lord. He'll give you the water and tell you everything you need to know.
DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_FIRST_NEVER_07_01.wav|That's no good way of treating friends! I think I'll have to teach you some manners!
DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_FIRST_LATER_07_01.wav|But I won't need anybody later. I need your help right NOW. Do you want to help me or not?

DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_NEVERAGAIN_07_01.wav|Oh? Have you got better plans?
DUMMY/DIA_LEFTY_NEVERAGAIN_07_02.wav|I think I'll have to remind you who's the boss!
