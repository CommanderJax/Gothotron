DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_DIEGOSENTME_09_01.wav|Huh... If Diego thinks you're okay, why doesn't HE take care of you?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_DIEGOSENTME_09_02.wav|Look, let me explain: Diego's gonna test you. If HE thinks you're good enough, I'll let you into the castle to see Gomez.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_DIEGOSENTME_09_03.wav|Whatever happens after that is up to you, okay?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYME_09_01.wav|It ain't that easy, kid! Any newcomer who wants to get anywhere needs a patron.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYME_09_02.wav|That patron has to be one of Gomez' people. He'll test you.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYME_09_03.wav|And if you fail, you're his responsibility - that's the law around here.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYMEAGAIN_09_01.wav|No. The things we guards deal with are a bit above you, kid.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYMEAGAIN_09_02.wav|You just stick to the tasks your patron sets for you.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYMEICANDOIT_09_01.wav|Oh? So you're intent on failing, eh... There is one thing that only someone who's not with Gomez can see to.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_TRYMEICANDOIT_09_02.wav|But I'm warning you: You blow this, and you'll be in mighty big trouble.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_OFFER_09_01.wav|What I'm about to tell you is between you and me, and nobody else must ever hear about it, understood?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_OFFER_09_03.wav|We have a problem with a guy from the New Camp. His name's Mordrag. He's been stealing from the Ore Barons.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_OFFER_09_04.wav|Of course that applies to a lot of the rogues in the New Camp, but this guy has the nerve to come to OUR camp and sell OUR stolen goods to OUR boys!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_OFFER_09_05.wav|He's gone too far. But he knows I can't do anything about it.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_OFFER_09_07.wav|Because he's under the protection of the Mages.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_KILLHIM_09_01.wav|I want you to make sure I never see his face around here again. I don't care how you do it.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MAGESPROTECT_09_01.wav|Because they use him as a gofer. Our local mages are in contact with the mages over in the New Camp. They often send gofers back and forth.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MAGESPROTECT_09_02.wav|They're likely to become VERY unpleasant if I throw one of their gofers out of the Camp or have him killed.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MAGESPROTECT_09_04.wav|You're new here. You'll be okay. But I'm responsible for what my boys do. That's why it's vital that you keep your mouth shut.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MAGEPROBLEM_09_01.wav|Yeah, but they're a problem that's hard to solve. A few years back one of the Shadows tried to stab the High Magician of the Circle of Fire while he was sleeping.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MAGEPROBLEM_09_02.wav|They found him later in the Outer Ring - in fact, he was scattered ALL OVER the Outer Ring.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGKO_MORDRAGDEAD_09_01.wav|You mean you defeated him? That's not bad, kid.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGFAILED_09_00.wav|You failed! I told you NOT TO MENTION MY NAME!!!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_MORDRAGFAILED_09_01.wav|You've blown it! Just forget the whole thing! Don't you dare try to have anything else to do with the matter!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_BRIBEGUARD_09_01.wav|For a certain amount...
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_BRIBEGUARD_09_02.wav|Well - it'd have to take a while to count the ore. Long enough to make sure me and my boys are busy counting while you slip by.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_BRIBEGUARD_09_04.wav|Well, you could join up with Gomez, that'd get you in the castle for free.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_GIVE1000ORE_09_01.wav|Alright, go ahead. You can go in the castle, but don't do anything stupid, okay?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_GIVE1000ORE_09_02.wav|Don't try'n trick me, kid. You don't have 1000 nuggets of ore!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_LETTERFORMAGES_09_01.wav|And you expect me to let you stroll inside the castle to hand it over and collect your reward?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_LETTERFORMAGES_09_03.wav|Okay, show me the letter.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_LETTERFORMAGES_09_05.wav|Okay, I've forgotten.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_READYFORGOMEZ_09_01.wav|That's my decision!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_READYFORGOMEZ_09_03.wav|Hmmm...
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_READYFORGOMEZ_09_04.wav|I must admit you seem to have done most things okay.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_READYFORGOMEZ_09_05.wav|Okay! You can see Gomez. He alone will decide whether you get to join us or not.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_READYFORGOMEZ_09_06.wav|From now on, you're on your own, kid.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KRAUTBOTE_09_01.wav|Show me!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KRAUTBOTE_09_02.wav|Hmmmmmmm...
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KRAUTBOTE_09_04.wav|You don't have enough weed to be a gofer! I hope for your sake that you haven't sold the stuff elsewhere! Come back when you have the right amount!
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KDWSIEGEL_09_01.wav|You have a messenger's amulet with you. That'll get you past the guards.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KDWSIEGEL_09_02.wav|I want nothing to do with the mages. So stop bothering me, will you?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_KDWSIEGEL_09_03.wav|Sure you are. I guess you must have mislaid your amulet, eh?
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_STTGESCHAFFT_09_01.wav|Congratulations, kid! You'd better stick close to Diego from now on.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_STTGESCHAFFT_09_02.wav|Only go to Gomez or Raven if you have something REALLY important to say.
DUMMY/INFO_THORUS_PERM2_09_01.wav|We're not having much trouble from the New Camp. I'm more worried about those sect loonies.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_GARDIST_INFO_09_02.wav|Yes. What you did in the mine not only shows some courage, but it also proves your strength and your fighting skills.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_GARDIST_INFO_09_03.wav|I'm ready to accept you into the ranks of the guards.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_GARDIST_INFO_09_04.wav|But you're not quite ready to become a guard yet. You need to gather a little more experience before I can take you on.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_GARDIST_INFO_09_05.wav|I'm giving you a chance. What do you say?
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_02.wav|I'm glad to hear it. But first I must tell you something that I tell all new recruits. Listen carefully, I shall say this only once.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_03.wav|So far, you've tried to get by on your own. Those days are over now. My boys stick together. We guards protect the Ore Barons, the ore, the camp and the mine.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_04.wav|The diggers collect the ore, but we make sure that they don't get eaten by crawlers. The Ore Barons negotiate with the King, but we're the ones that protect them.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_05.wav|Day and night, we're in the mine. Day and night, we stand at the gates of the Camp and make sure folks get to sleep peacefully.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_07.wav|I only expect one thing from my boys: that they stick together. Only by standing together will we be able to hold on to what we have.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_08.wav|And to survive.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_09.wav|You'll learn everything else in due course. Be ready and help out wherever help is needed or something needs to be done.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_10.wav|Go and ask Stone to give you some armor and a sword.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_AUFNAHME_INFO_09_11.wav|You'll find Stone in the blacksmith's shop in the Inner Ring.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_NOCHWAS_INFO_09_01.wav|Oh, one more thing...
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_NOCHWAS_INFO_09_02.wav|Welcome to the Guards.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_WANNABEMAGE_INFO_09_02.wav|Well, in that case maybe you should talk to Corristo. He taught Milten. I'm sure there's nothing to stop you.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_TEACH_09_01.wav|I can show you how to improve your skill and strength.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_02.wav|Okay, let's go through the basics first.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_03.wav|Hold the sword in a horizontal position. You'll need more swing to attack your opponent with such a heavy weapon.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_04.wav|Raise your arm and swing it straight down. That's usually enough to knock the opponent down.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_05.wav|Use the momentum of the weapon to bring it straight back up again.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_06.wav|Two-handed swords are ideal for coordinating side hits to keep opponents at a distance.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND1_INFO_09_07.wav|That should do to begin with. Have a practice.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_02.wav|First of all, you need to change your basic stance. Hold the sword vertically, grasp the hilt firmly in both hands and hold it at the side of your body.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_03.wav|Bring it down quickly and swing the blade over your shoulder. Now's your chance to do a quick slash to your right.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_04.wav|Your opponent won't have time to come at you.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_05.wav|Or bring the sword down from the top left in a forward thrust to drive your opponent back.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_06.wav|Spin around to give your next blow the necessary momentum to strike your opponent down.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_07.wav|If it isn't enough, use your remaining swing to wield the sword again.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_08.wav|When you've finished your attack, block your opponent and wait for an opening to strike again.
DUMMY/GRD_200_THORUS_ZWEIHAND2_INFO_09_09.wav|The key to success is varying your stances and changing positions.
